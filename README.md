 Wellcome to movie app!
 
 You can use the application to search for different movies and to
 create your own watchlist saved for you on your local storage

 If you want to save the watchlist on a database, to prevent loosing
 your watchlist by mistake, you can create an account with an email
 adress, and save the watchlist from there😊💾. After you save it, you
 can bring them back anytime

 By clicking on the image of the movies it will take you to the detail
 page, where you find more details about the movie you selected, and
 there you can see the movie trailer▶️

  From there you can see similar movies and recomandations according to
  the movie selected 😊🎥

  On the home page you have the search compartiment, the Popular movies
  and your watchlist

  You can swith to dark mode or light mode, as you wish.
  Feel free to explore the Movie App 😊

  We don't save any personal informations, and don't use them in any
  way! 👍

 Your watchlist is saved on your local storage, and you can delete it
 very easy (there are dedicated buttons), and if you oppen the app from
 another device it will not be there!

 If you want to save the watchlist on a database, you can create an
 account, and save the watchlist from there. Your email adress and
 password will be saved encrypted on a database, so you can
 authenticate safe.
 
 If you don't want to make an account with your email adress, you can
 use the dummy account to see how it works.

  dummy email: test@yahoo.com
  dummy password: testpassword
  
  Even if you create an account, we will NOT use your informations in
  any way!👍
